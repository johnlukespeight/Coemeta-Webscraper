# Security Fixes Applied

## üö® Critical Security Issue Resolved

Google detected exposed service account credentials in your public GitHub repository. The following fixes have been applied:

## ‚úÖ Actions Taken

### 1. **Removed Exposed Credentials**

- ‚úÖ Deleted `spartan-rhino-434020-h1-a244eeb7b709.json` from repository
- ‚úÖ This file contained your actual private key and has been removed

### 2. **Enhanced .gitignore Protection**

- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive patterns to prevent credential commits:
  - `*.json` (catches all JSON files)
  - `service_account.json`
  - `*-a244eeb7b709.json` (specific to your exposed key)
  - `credentials/` and `secrets/` directories

### 3. **Removed Hardcoded Paths**

- ‚úÖ Fixed `google_sheets.py` - removed hardcoded credential path
- ‚úÖ Fixed `main.py` - replaced hardcoded paths with configuration
- ‚úÖ Fixed `streamlit_app.py` - updated default path to relative

### 4. **Created Secure Configuration System**

- ‚úÖ Created `config.py` for secure credential management
- ‚úÖ Added environment variable support (`GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH`)
- ‚úÖ Added credential validation functions
- ‚úÖ Implemented fallback to local file with proper security

### 5. **Updated Documentation**

- ‚úÖ Enhanced README.md with security warnings
- ‚úÖ Added detailed setup instructions
- ‚úÖ Included security best practices
- ‚úÖ Created credential setup helper script

### 6. **Created Helper Tools**

- ‚úÖ Created `setup_credentials.py` for secure credential setup
- ‚úÖ Added JSON validation for service account files
- ‚úÖ Provided clear instructions for environment variables

## üîí Security Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required:

1. **Rotate Your Service Account Key**

   - Go to Google Cloud Console
   - Navigate to IAM & Admin > Service Accounts
   - Find `coemeta-webscraper-sheets@spartan-rhino-434020-h1.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
   - Delete the exposed key (ID: a244eeb7b709f6a9b8c5dcac52f54073f79a3388)
   - Create a new key immediately
   - Update your application with the new credentials

2. **Monitor for Abuse**

   - Check Google Cloud Console for unusual activity
   - Review billing and usage logs
   - Set up alerts for unusual API usage

3. **Review Repository History**
   - Check if credentials were committed in git history
   - Consider using `git filter-branch` if needed
   - Ensure no other sensitive files are exposed

### Future Prevention:

1. **Use Environment Variables**

   ```bash
   export GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH="/path/to/your/service_account.json"
   ```

2. **Regular Security Audits**

   - Review .gitignore regularly
   - Check for hardcoded paths
   - Rotate credentials periodically

3. **Use the Setup Script**
   ```bash
   python setup_credentials.py
   ```

## üìÅ Files Modified

- ‚úÖ `.gitignore` - Enhanced protection
- ‚úÖ `google_sheets.py` - Removed hardcoded paths
- ‚úÖ `main.py` - Updated to use secure configuration
- ‚úÖ `streamlit_app.py` - Updated default paths
- ‚úÖ `README.md` - Added security documentation
- ‚úÖ `config.py` - New secure configuration system
- ‚úÖ `setup_credentials.py` - New helper script

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Run the setup script**: `python setup_credentials.py`
2. **Rotate your Google service account key** (CRITICAL)
3. **Test the application** with new credentials
4. **Monitor for any unusual activity** in your Google Cloud account

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- The exposed credentials have been **permanently deleted** from your repository
- Your application now uses **secure configuration management**
- All hardcoded paths have been **removed**
- The `.gitignore` file now **protects all credential files**

**Remember**: Never commit credentials to version control, always use environment variables or secure configuration files, and rotate credentials immediately if exposed.
